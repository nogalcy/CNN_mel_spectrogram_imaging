This project was done as a way to introduce myself to using Neural Networks like CNN with audio data. Comments should list out what is happening, but essentially we take the audio input, use librosa to transform it into a mel-spectrogram that is then used with a neural network. This process has a 93% validation accuracy, but could be improved with less epochs (overkill in this notebook) and potential transfer learning with model such as ResNet or others for image data.
